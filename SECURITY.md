# Markhor Security Policy üè∞

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Markhor, please report it to us without delay. We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing any issues you may find.  
If you are unsure if what you found is a vulnerability, do treat it as such.

To report a security vulnerability, please visit: [https://github.com/markhork8s/markhor/security/advisories](https://github.com/markhork8s/markhor/security/advisories). If for any reason that is inaccessible, use the contacts you find [here](https://zanol.li/#contacts), but only the ones that provide an encrypted channel -i.e., matrix-. Do not use any public or unencrypted channel to communicate with us about security vulnerabilities.

In your report, please include the following:
1. A description of the vulnerability
1. Steps to reproduce it
1. Potential impacts and risks
1. Which version of Markhor, K8s, SOPS, etc. you used
1. Any proposals you may have on how to fix it

## Disclosure Policy

If you are eager to share with others your discovery, we understand the enthusiasm and will be there to celebrate with you once it is patched.  
At the same time, we need time to properly assess and address the issue. Therefore, we request that you _do not_ share the vulnerability with anyone other than the project's maintainers until we have publicly released a fix OR 90 days have passed since when you reported it to us.

We will recognize in the release notes that you found that vulnerability (and if you contributed to the fix).

## Maintainer Commitment

As the current sole maintainer of Markhor, I am committed to addressing any security issues that may arise to the best of my ability. Please understand that as a solo maintainer, I may not be able to provide immediate fixes, but I will work diligently to resolve any security concerns in a timely manner.

That said, any help is appreciated since I'd like this project to grow and be community-driven.
