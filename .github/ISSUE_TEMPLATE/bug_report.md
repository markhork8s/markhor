- [ ] I checked that this is not a duplicate of existing issues/pull requests.

- [ ] I am quite sure this is an issue with the Markhor project itself and not with any of the other technologies it interacts with (SOPS, Kubernetes, etc.).

## Detailed steps to reproduce

<description style="display:none">
Include here relevant Kubernetes manifests, command outputs, error messages or logs. If the previous sections already contain everything, you can delete this one.

Example:

1. Clone the repo
1. Run this command `echo "abcd"`
1. Apply the manifest for service foo:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: foo
   kind: bar
   ```
1. You should get the error in the logs: `could not do X because Y failed at Z`
